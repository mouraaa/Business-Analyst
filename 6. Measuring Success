Measuring Success:
——————————————————————————————————————————
Make sure to establish some quantifiable benchmarks
	EX: how many minutes does it take for a sales rep to make a quote and email it to their customer?
		how often do your service agents need to make a return visit after installing a home appliance? 

Run your benchmarks on the existing process. If you get ambiguous results, the tests aren’t very valuable, and you need to revise them. If they are good tests, then you’ll have baseline results that you can compare against once you have a solution in place. 

——————————————————————————————————————————
Benefits:

1. clients want to know how much things have improved because it helps calculate their ROI 
2. the benchmark data is also a reflection of you. It proves to the client that your skills are effective. 
3. you can add these metrics to your resume
