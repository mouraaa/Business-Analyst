First things to do when you land a project:
	
	1. Read up on all documentation the project has (all maps, fsd's, etc)

	2. Figure out who is responsible for what and who is whose boss
		this is so you know who to go to for what

	3. Understand the current state / business process
		When you’re asked to improve a business process, you need to fully understand what your stakeholders are currently doing and why there’s a need for improvement. You have to be a detective and to do that, you need to shine a light on the current state.

	4. Identify stakeholders 

	5. Disocver business objectives


After background information is done, you can start to do workshops to understand more. Then you can provide suggestions.

Questions to ask:

	-whats the current process?
	-whats the problem with using this current process?
	-whats the business doing to alleviate or solve the issue currently? 
		you dont want to come up with a plan that was already tried in the past
		if theres a vendor, they would want to know what the client was doing before

	-are there any effects or risks with this solution? 
	-are there any other cheaper/alternate solutions?
	-are there any time constraint?

	-who are the end users? (people who will use the product)
	-who are the stakeholders? (people who are actively involved in the project or whose interest will be affected bc of project completion)
