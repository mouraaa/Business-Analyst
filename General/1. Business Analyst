First things to do when you land a project:
	
	1. Read up on all documentation the project has (all maps, fsd's, etc)
		-make sure the documentation is credible and up to date 

	2. Identify stakeholders and out who is responsible for what and who is whose boss
		-this is so you know who to go to for what
		-create/look at the stakeholder sheet

	3. Understand the current state / business process
		-when you’re asked to improve a business process, you need to fully understand what your stakeholders are currently doing and why there’s a need for improvement. You have to be a detective and to do that, you need to shine a light on the current state.

	4. Disocver business objectives

After background information is done, you can start to do workshops to understand more. Then you can provide suggestions.

Goal: how do we move this process from the legacy system over to the new system?

Questions to ask:

	-whats the current process?
	-whats the problem with using this current process?
	-whats the business doing to alleviate or solve the issue currently?
		you dont want to come up with a plan that was already tried in the past
		if theres a vendor, they would want to know what the client was doing before

	-are there any effects or risks with this solution?
	-are there any other cheaper/alternate solutions?
	-are there any time constraint?

	-who are the end users? (people who will use the product)
	-who are the stakeholders? (people who are actively involved in the project or whose interest will be affected bc of project completion)

BA's are often times need to find answers or ask questions but the answers aren't readily available. 

Solution: BA's rely on their technology skills to look at artifacts such as process flow diagrams, database schemas, swaggers, or other tech artefacts and knowledge bases that could provide answers or leads in whatever topic being investigated. 

ie: the more tools you have at your disposal to advance and gain knowledge, the more you would be able to progress and articulate questions that can lead to the responses being sought when those are not readily available
