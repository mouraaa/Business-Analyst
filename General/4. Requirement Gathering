Requirement Gathering:
——————————————————————————————————————————
1. Identify stakeholders
	determine who will be affected by the project and who should provide input.

2. Collect information using the below to gather information about the needs and expectations of stakeholders.
	-interviews
	-surveys
	-open ended questionnares
	-workshops
	-shadowing
	-document analysis: gathering information by analyzing already existing documents

3. Work with the product owner to prioritize requirements

4. Document requirements in the URS (user requrements specifications)
——————————————————————————————————————————
Terminology:

High level requriements: specifies requirements from a glance
Low  level requriements: extremely detailed to meet the high level requirements

Business Requirements:
	-high-level statements of goals, objectives, and needs. 
	-business requirements do not have any details or specific features. They just state the problem and the business objective to be achieved
	-ex : increased revenue/customer reach, reduced expenses/errors, improved customer service, etc.

User Requirements:
	-reflects the needs of stakeholder groups and defines what they expect from a particular solution
	-They're the bridge between generalized business requirements and specific solution requirements. 
	-EX: the ability to create various reports, view order history and status, manage customer databases, etc.

Product/Solution requirements:
	-describe specific characteristics that a product must have to meet the requirements of the business and users. 
	-They fall into two large groups (functional and non functional requirements)

——————————————————————————————————————————
Systems need both functional requirements and non functional requirements to be usable. Without functional requirements the system will not work. Without non functional requirements, users will become frustrated

1. Functional requirements: 
	-explains how the system should work
	-define what a product must do and what its features and functions are.
	-Examples:
		-The system must send a confirmation email whenever an order is placed
		-The system must allow blog visitors to sign up for the newsletter


2. Nonfunctional requirements: 
	-explains how the system should perform
	-describes the general properties and performance of a system
	-Examples:
		-speed: how fast the system performs certain activities
		-availability: how long the system is available (ie: does it operate overnight, holidays, etc
		-capacity: any limitations of the system (ex: how many users on the website at one time)
		-reliability: how dependable the system is
		-usability: how easy the system is to use for an end user
			-diff users have diff levels of computer literacy
			-some users are vision impaired, color blind, etc
		-security

Non functional requirements are harder to capture since they are less well defined. 
However, think of all the different scenarios and types of users that will be using the system and what their needs can be.

Requirement vs Need:

-needs are broader statements that describe the underlying desires or objectives that customer is trying to address. 

-requirements are the specific, measurable, time bound features, functions, or characteristics that a product or service must have to meet the customer's needs.

In order to create effective requirements, the business analyst must understand the needs of the business and then translate them into specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound requirements.
