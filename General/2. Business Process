Business Process:
——————————————————————————————————————————
A collection of related, structured activities or tasks performed by people or equipment in which a specific sequence produces a service or product for a particular customer or customers

You need to understand:
	1. the entire E2E process
	2. what are the events that trigger a change to happen because it has an implication in the E2E process
	3. why these events are are being triggered in case you need to troubleshoot
	4. limitations of each process
	5. how to implement things into each process

Example: 

Accenture is working with salesforce on an account opening process. The business wants us to enable a specific data field to be captured during account opening (ex: country of origination. this is bc it could be an internal or foreign business and these things have tax implications)

Down the road, there were failures in the E2E process and we didnt know why. The field was working from A -> B but not from B -> F
Turns out, the data field wasnt compatable with C-> D, hence the failure. It was only working from A -> B

Hence, a BA needs to know that every data point is to support a process so you need to make sure that everything you do works with the entire process, not just from A->B and WHY
