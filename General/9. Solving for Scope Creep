Scope Creep:
——————————————————————————————————————————
Scope creep: when the scope of the project gradually expands beyond its original parameters. 

This can happen bc: 
	1. changes in the requirements 
	2. changes in objectives of the project
	3. poor planning.

Avoiding scope creep:
	1. have a clear and concise definition of the project's scope from the outset, and to make sure that all stakeholders agree on this definition. 
	2. have a well-defined change management process in place, so that any changes to the scope are carefully considered and approved 
	3. regular communication with all stakeholders helps ensure that everyone is aware of the project's current parameters and objectives.

If you are experiencing scope creep in your own project, it is important to take action to address the problem as soon as possible. Allowing the scope to continue to expand unchecked can lead to significant delays and cost overruns, and can ultimately jeopardize the success of the project.
