Business Case:
——————————————————————————————————————————
A document that lays out the problem/opportunity and what the value would be to create a project and to fullfill that idea. 
This is more in depth and in detail than the project proposal. 

NOTE: remember that most people seeing the business case likely have no idea about the problem or the project. Introduce the problem as if youre explaining it to someone with zero knowledge. 

Sections:
	1. Executive Summary
		Whats the problem/solution/departments engaged, stakeholders, 

	2. Problem Statement

	3. Analysis
		-what why and how of the project
		-budget
		-resources
		-timelines
		-explanation of what what would happen if this doesnt turn to a project

	4. Solution Options
		-one of the options always has to be that nothing is done.

	5. Cost Benefit Analysis
		-breaks down each solution and the return on investment and when well see the benefit if we choose that option


	6. Reccomendation
		-what solution they reccomend and how they came to that decision
		-what methodologies should be used
		-what resources should be used
