It's the dashboard that offers a quick glimpse into the health of your project.

it's a framework that helps you identify, assess, and prioritize various elements of project management.

Risks: an uncertain event that, if it occurs, can negatively or positively impact a project's objectives

Examples of Common Risks:
	budget overruns
	scope creep
	resource allocation issues 
	Market forces such as competitor actions or changes in consumer preference, can also create risks

Understanding these examples can help managers take pre-emptive measures.
The goal is to create a comprehensive list of potential risks that could impact the project.

Identifying Risks:
	There are various techniques for risk identification, such as SWOT analysis, expert interviews, and historical data review. 

Analyzing Risks:
	Once risks are identified, they should be analyzed both quantitatively and qualitatively. 
	Quantitative analysis looks at potential cost and time impacts
	Qualitative analysis gauges the likelihood and severity.

Mitigating Risks:
	Mitigation strategies may include contingency planning or allocating additional resources. 
	It's crucial to develop actionable steps to either reduce the likelihood of the risk occurring or minimize its impact should it occur.

Monitoring Risks:
	Risk management is an ongoing process. Continuous monitoring and periodic reassessments are essential to ensuring that risks are effectively managed throughout the project life cycle.

Assumptions: foundational beliefs or statements presumed to be true at the beginning of a project

Making Assumptions Explicit and validate.

Issues: obstacles that have already occurred and are negatively impacting the project

Issue resolution often involves identification, analysis, and the development of a resolution strategy. 
The use of an issue log can be helpful in tracking these steps. 
There should also be issue escalation process in place to know who to escalate to.

Dependencies: tasks, milestones, or activities that are linked.

They are inevitable because projects don't exist in a vacuum. 
One team's progress often impacts another, and tasks frequently need to be completed in a particular order.
