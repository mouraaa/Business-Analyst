BRD: Business Requirements Document
——————————————————————————————————————————
A BRD is always prepared by the business analyst on the project and is created after performing an analysis of the client company and talking to the stakeholders. Once a BRD is prepared, it’s often reviewed and signed off by the client to ensure it correctly captures the business’s expectations and the key stakeholders.

Main Points:
	-one of the first documents created in the project life cycle
	-contains high-level business requirements and stakeholder requirements
	-captures why the requirements are being taken (not the how)
	-primary audience is project sponsors, higher management, middle management, and analysts.

EX: improve effiency by tracking the employee time in the office
