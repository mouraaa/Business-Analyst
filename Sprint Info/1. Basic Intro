Agile: an approach to managing projects that focuses on continious smaller releases that provides flexibility and the ability to adjust to new requriements. 
—————————————————————————————————————————— 
Agile can be implemented using different frameworks, one of which is scrum

Scrum: 
	1. provides structure and schedule to the team. 
	2. productivity is measured in story points completed in each sprint
	3. everyone is organized into small cross functional teams
	4. teams work in short iterations called sprints
	5. deliver or demo something every sprint

Ask: how do they point stories? Point system? Points per day, effort, risk?

SAFE (Scaled Agile Framework):

a comprehensive framework for scaling agile and lean principles across an organization. It was created to address the challenges of applying agile practices at scale, particularly in large enterprises with multiple teams working on complex projects.

SAFe requires a more structured and hierarchical approach for implementing agile methodologies across organizational levels for teams and portfolios, which might align better with organizations accustomed to traditional project management methodologies.
