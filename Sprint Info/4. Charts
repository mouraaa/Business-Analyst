Scrum Charts:
——————————————————————————————————————————
Burndown chart: 
	shows the amount of work remaining on a project (the remaining effort)
	the line goes from top to bottom as a team makes progress
	only one line

Burnup chart: 
	shows how much work has been completed and the total scope of the project
	the line climbs from the bottom upwards
	harder to read as there are 3 lines
		1. total effort required to finish sprint
		2. work completed so far
		3. ideal work pace needed to meet the project’s deadline

Scope creep is a well know anti-pattern in agile development teams—it happens when more work is added during a sprint, which can disrupt agile estimations and processes.  

When scope creep occurs, a burn-down chart will give the impression that the project is progressing as usual. However, on a burn-up chart, a dramatic increase in the scope of a project is clearly visible.
