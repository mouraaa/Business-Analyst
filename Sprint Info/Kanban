Kanban
——————————————————————————————————————————
Agile can be implemented using different frameworks, one of which is kanban

Kanban is still an approach to managing projects that focuses on continious smaller releases that provides flexibility and the ability to adjust to new requriements.

Kanban is good for projects that deal with interruption driven work 
	(work that is difficult to predict in advance but needs a team in place to handle it when it comes up)
	ie: service, platform support, etc

If work priority keeps changing, dont know the items that will be worked on in the future, or you find it difficult to commit to a scope fo work for 2-4 weeks (depending on sprint length), kanban might be a better choise

Differences:

1. Kanban is a framework that relies on visual tasks to manage workflows.
2. There are no predefined roles (ie: no scrum master)
3. tasks are shared by everyone instead of assigned owners
4. work starts as soon as there is someone with capacity to work on it and ends when the task is completed
5. the top of the backlog is always the next thing to be worked on
6. timelines evolve on an 'as-needed' bases
	ie: if a higher priority item comes, you can work on it when another task is finished (in scrum, it waits for the next sprint)
7. productivity is measured by the cycle time of the task rather than the number of story points completed in each sprint
