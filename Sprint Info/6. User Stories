User Stories:
——————————————————————————————————————————
User story: a general explanation of a feature written from the perspective of the end user or customer
	The purpose of a user story is to articulate how a piece of work will deliver value back to the customer

How to write: "As a [who], I want [what] so that [why]"
	- the 'who' should not just be a job title. We're after the persona of that person.
	- the 'what' should be implementation free. Shouldnt be desribing the UI. Should focus what the overall what.

User stories should follow the acronym INVEST

Independent:
	-a user story should not depend on other user stories. 
	-otherwise, it risks becoming a blocker for other features.
	-can be prioritized and worked on independently.

Negotiable:
	-user stories should be written in a way that leaves room for negotiation. 
	-they should not be too specific or too detailed. 
	-allows for flexibility and allows the team to add their own insights during implementation.

Valuable:
	-a user story should always represent value for the user. It should be something that the user wants or needs.

Estimable:
	-user stories should be small enough that they can be estimated. 
	-if a user story is too big, it should be broken down into smaller user stories.

Sized-Appropriately:
	-user stories should be the right size. 
	-they should not be too big or too small. 
	-the team should have a good understanding of what the user story is and what it entails before starting work on it.

Testable:
	-user stories should be testable. 
	-must be quantifiable and verifiable. 
	-your requirement can’t be, for example, to make something prettier or more user-friendly, because there is no way to measure something’s attractiveness or user-friendliness. 
	-should have Acceptance Criteria that can be used to verify that the user story has been implemented correctly.
