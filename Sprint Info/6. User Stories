User Stories:
——————————————————————————————————————————
User story: a general explanation of a feature written from the perspective of the end user or customer
	The purpose of a user story is to articulate how a piece of work will deliver value back to the customer

How to write: "As a [who], I want [what] so that [why]"
	- the 'who' should just be a job title. We're after the persona of that person.
	- the 'what' should be implementation free. Shouldnt be desribing the UI. Should focus what the overall what.

Notes: 

	1. User stories should be small.
	2. Every user story should have at least one acceptance criteria
	3. it must be quantifiable and verifiable. This means that your requirement can’t be, for example, to make something prettier or more user-friendly, because there is no way to measure something’s attractiveness or user-friendliness.
