Use Case Diagram
——————————————————————————————————————————
-use-case diagrams model the behavior of a system and help to capture the requirements of the system.
-describes what the system does and how the actors use it, NOW how the system operates internally.

You can model a complex system with a single use-case diagram, or create many use-case diagrams to model the components of the system.

When to create:
	Before starting a project so that everyone shares an understanding of the workers, customers, and activities of the business.

Use cases:
	-A use case describes a function that a system performs to achieve the user’s goal. A use case must yield an observable result that is of value to the user of the system.

Actors:
	-An actor represents a role of a user that interacts with the system that you are modeling. The user can be a human user, an organization, a machine, or another external system.
