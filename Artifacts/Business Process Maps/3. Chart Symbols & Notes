Chart Symbols: https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/flowchart-symbols-meaning-explained
——————————————————————————————————————————
Notes:

	-There can be multiple 'starts' depending on the number of possible inputs
		EX: an "alert response" process can start in many ways depending on how the alert came through 
			ie: caller, police, etc

		the multiple starts will join together once the process starts, but the 'starts' might be in multiple swimlanes

	-the starts can be at the bottom and can work their way to tne end to the top. 

——————————————————————————————————————————
Swimlane Flowcharts: 

used to represent who owns what part of the process.
	-can be a specific user (administrator, salesperson, manager) 
	-can be a department (administration, sales, management)

On Page Reference:

-used to jump to a diff part of the process
-when you cross this indicator, it means the next step is somewhere else on the same page. think of it as a portal
-good to use when you want to end the process early, or theres many decisions and you want to skip some tasks, etc
-letters are used

Off Page Reference 

-can be used 2 ways
	1. when you want to continue the flowchart onto a new page bc theres no space
		-theres no flow through (ie: dont come back to continue the next process)
	
	2. when you want to use it as a flow through
		ex: process -> off page ref -> process
		the off page ref indicates to go to a diff page then come back to continue to the next process

		-instead of having one huge chart, you can break it up
		-this is good for readability
		-a good usecase is when theres a happy path that happens 95% of the time so the flow through can be used for a failure path 

-numbers are used

Levels: process maps can have multiple levels. 

	1. Level 0 describes the highest level of the process with very few details.
		-should only have very few symbols (start, end and process tasks)
		-shouldn't have decisions, store data, input/output, etc
		-each task is represented with whole numbers (1.0, 2.0, etc)

	2. Level 1 describes level 0 in more detail 
		-each process is delved into deeper
		-each task is represented with a decimal (1.1, 1.2, etc)

	3. level 2 describes level 1 in more detail
		-each level 1 task  is delved into deeper
		-each task is represented with a letter (1.1a, 1.1b, etc)
