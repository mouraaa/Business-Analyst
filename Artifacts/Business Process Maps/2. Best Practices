Best Practices for drawing:
——————————————————————————————————————————
	1. keep it simple. should be easy to read by anyone
	2. use straight arrows, and right angle arrows. never use curved.
	3. never cross data flow arrows.
	4. save the arrows for last. dont try to add them as you go along. itll get really annoying really fast
	5. dont use full sentences in the process boxes. should be very short and high level (verb and a noun)
	6. use the appropriate/correct symbols on your diagram
	7. reccomendations: (these are not musts, but nice to have's if it makes sense)
		-have the start symbol on its own row at the very top leftso people can naturally find the start of the process
		-have the end symbol on its own row at the very bottom right people can naturally find the end of the process
		-have the start/end symbols in a separate/green/beige color

Questions to ask & info to add on the map:

	1. where does the process start and end?
	2. what steps are between the beginning and the end?
	3. what are the inputs and outputs of the process?
	4. who needs to do what and when do they need to do it?

Keep in mind:

	1. create an initial draft
	2. ask people who are involved in the process
		-have them fill in the gaps and correct mistakes in your draft.
		-encourage them to share the smallest of details so that your process flow is as complete as possible.
		-every little detail can hold within it an opportunity to change things for the better.
	3. include all key stakeholders to avoid missing out on important steps
	4. don’t fix your processes until they are fully mapped
