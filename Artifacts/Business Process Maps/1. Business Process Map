Business Process Map:
——————————————————————————————————————————
One of the best ways to get a deep understanding of how your business does things today is to create a process map.

Process: a series of tasks that is taken to complete a task

Process Map: a visual representation of every step and decision that’s made to complete a process from start to finish. (some maps show who does what) Essentially, its the entire workflow from start to end. It is a great way to engage stakeholders, identify improvements and start the change process.

Benefits:

1. aligns everyone on the current process
2. reveals inefficiencies with the current process 
3. it helps evaluate how potential solutions integrate with the current process. 
4. a great “before and after” to illustrate how things have improved over the course of the project.
5. a good visualization tool rather than a paragraph.

Different Models for Drawing Process Maps:

1. UPN Model
	-activity box must start with a verb
	-activity box includes what happens, what systems are used and who is responsible
	-should be no more than 8-10 boxes on a screen
	-each box can be drilled down to go into more detail (no limit to the number of levels that you can go down)

2. UML

3. BPMN

4. Flowcharts

5. SIPOC
	-Suppliers
	-Inputs
	-Process

	-used to gather key points to prepare for a more detailed map

6. Value Stream Map
	-maps the flow of material and info thats needed to bring a product to the customer
	-records the measurements of inputs and outputs
	-goal is to identify waste and minimize it
	-information is from right to left
	-process is from left to right
