Business Process Map:
——————————————————————————————————————————
One of the best ways to get a deep understanding of how your business does things today is to create a process map.

Process: a series of tasks that is taken to complete a task

Process Map: a visual representation of every step and decision that’s made to complete a process from start to finish. (some maps show who does what) Essentially, its the entire workflow from start to end. It is a great way to engage stakeholders, identify improvements and start the change process.

Benefits:

1. aligns everyone on the current process
2. reveals inefficiencies with the current process 
3. it helps evaluate how potential solutions integrate with the current process. 
4. a great “before and after” to illustrate how things have improved over the course of the project.
5. a good visualization tool rather than a paragraph.

Tools to draw process maps:
	1. Draw.io (free)
	2. Visio 
	3. Lucidchart

Swimlane Flowcharts: 

used to represent who owns what part of the process.
	-can be a specific user (administrator, salesperson, manager) 
	-can be a department (administration, sales, management)

Notes:

	-There can be multiple 'starts' depending on the number of possible inputs
		EX: an "alert response" process can start in many ways depending on how the alert came through 
			ie: caller, police, etc

		the multiple starts will join together once the process starts, but the 'starts' might be in multiple swimlanes

	-the starts can be at the bottom and can work their way to tne end to the top.

Levels: process maps can have multiple levels. 

	1. Level 0 describes the highest level of the process with very few details.
		-should only have very few symbols (start, end and process tasks)
		-shouldn't have decisions, store data, input/output, etc
		-each task is represented with whole numbers (1.0, 2.0, etc)

	2. Level 1 describes level 0 in more detail 
		-each process is delved into deeper
		-each task is represented with a decimal (1.1, 1.2, etc)

	3. level 2 describes level 1 in more detail
		-each level 1 task  is delved into deeper
		-each task is represented with a letter (1.1a, 1.1b, etc)
