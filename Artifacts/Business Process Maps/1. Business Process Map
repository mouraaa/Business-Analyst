One of the best ways to get a deep understanding of how your business does things today is to create a process map.

Process: a series of tasks that is taken to complete a task

Process Map: a visual representation of every step and decision that’s made to complete a process from start to finish. (some maps show who does what) Essentially, its the entire workflow from start to end. It is a great way to engage stakeholders, identify improvements and start the change process.
