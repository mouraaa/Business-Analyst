Activity Diagram:
——————————————————————————————————————————
a graphical representation using UML of the sequence of activities that take place in a system. The main purpose of an activity diagram is to model the flow of control within a system.

There are 4 important elements that should be included in an activity diagram:

	1. Activities: These are the actions that take place within the system.
	2. States: These represent the different states that an activity can be in.
	3. Transitions: These indicate the order in which the activities take place.
	4. Objects: These are the objects that are affected by the activities.

Activity Diagrams (AD's) vs Process Workflows:

1. AD's are more complex and offer more detail
2. AD's model not only the flow of activities but also the flow of objects or data between activities
2. AD's also show parallel or concurrent flows and alternate flows.
3. AD's use UML while process workflows do not

Basic Flow vs Exception Flow vs Alternate Flow:

	1. Basic flow: 
		-as the name suggests, the basic flow 

	2. Alternate flow: 
		-actions or activities other than basic flow. 
		-leads to same achieving the goals of the basic flow using different steps.
		
	3. Exception flow: 
		-actions executed in case of errors. 
		-used to handle errors or unexpected conditions that may occur during the execution of a program.
