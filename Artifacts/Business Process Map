Business Process Map:
——————————————————————————————————————————
One of the best ways to get a deep understanding of how your customer does things today is to create a business process map.

This is a visual representation of every step and decision that’s made to complete a process from start to finish as well as who does what. Essentially, its the entire workflow from start to end. It is a great way to engage stakeholders, identify improvements and start the change process.
——————————————————————————————————————————
Steps:
	1. create a draft
		Base your draft on intel you gather from existing documentation and training materials.

	2. meet with the people who know the process best
		Have them fill in the gaps and correct mistakes in your draft. Encourage them to share the smallest of details so that your process flow is as complete as possible. Every little detail can hold within it an opportunity to change things for the better.
——————————————————————————————————————————
Questions to ask & Info to add on the map:

	1. where does the process begin and end?
	2. what steps need are between the beginning and the end?
	3. what are the inputs and outputs of the process?
	4. who needs to do what and when do they need to do it?
——————————————————————————————————————————
Best Practices:

	1. Map the correct processes
		Processes that reflect how decisions are made may not be the best processes to map because they're limited in steps, and may not offer the most impact for your time. Sometimes the inefficiencies in your processes are outside of the process itself. It then becomes critical that you review any intersecting (secondary) processes as well.
	2. Don’t fix your processes until they are fully mapped
	3. ask people who are involved in the process
	4. include all key stakeholders to avoid missing out on important steps
	5. keep it simple. should be easy to read by anyone

Benefits:

1. aligns everyone on the process currently
2. reveals inefficiencies with the current process 
3. it helps evaluate how potential solutions integrate with the current process. 
4. a great “before and after” to illustrate how things have improved over the course of the project.
