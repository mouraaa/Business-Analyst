Project Scope Definition

https://asana.com/resources/project-scope
——————————————————————————————————————————
Project scope:
	-sets boundaries on your project
	-defines the goals, deadlines, and project deliverables

Purpose: 
	-manages stakeholder expectations
	-reduces project risk
	-budgets and plans resources
	-prevents scope creep
	-estableshes a process for chagne requests in complex projects
	-ensures you hit your project goals and objectives without delay or overwork.

Defining your project scope isn’t a one-person job. 
Rather, you should align with any important project stakeholders and ensure that you’re all on the same page. 

Scope Creep: continuous or uncontrolled growth in a project's scope. 
	ie: when changes are made to the project scope without any control procedure like change requests

——————————————————————————————————————————
Project Scope Statement: a written document of your project scope. Depending on the complexity of your project, your scope statement could be a section of your project plan, or it could be its own stand-alone document. 

Steps:
	1. start with project objectives/deliverables
	2. make a resource management plan (how you'll acquire, develop, use, manage, control, and release the resources you need for a particular project)

	3. boundaries/risks (budgets, resources etc)
	4. what will NOT be covered
	5. write draft
	6. establish a change request/control process if necessary
	7. review with stakeholders

based on project complexity, the project scope statement can be a bullet pointed list. a paragraph or a full blown SOW
