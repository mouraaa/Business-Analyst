Customer Discovery:
——————————————————————————————————————————
The initial and iterative process of understanding customers' situations, needs, and pain points.

	1. ask better questions (open ended, not yes or no)
	2. avoid assumptions
	3. dont soley rely on surveys as they cant replace direct conversations since they lack context and follow up questions
	4. show genuine interest
