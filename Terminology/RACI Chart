RACI chart: 
——————————————————————————————————————————
Used to clarify employee roles and responsibilities for each task, milestone and decision that takes place throughout a project.

A RACI chart comes in handy for complex and long-lasting projects that include lots of stakeholders, tasks and milestones, especially if work is overlapping. A project manager typically creates a RACI chart to avoid missing those important details and ensure clear communication throughout the project.

	1. Responsible: does the work or creates the deliverable
	2. Accountable: delegates and reviews the work. Makes sure the responsible person knows the expectations and completes work on time
	3. Consulted: people who provide input/feedback on the work. They might have a stake in the outcomes bc it could affect their current/future work
	4. Informed: people that need to be looped into the progress but not consulted or overwhelmed with the details of every task.
