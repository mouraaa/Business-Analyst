Journey maps are a visualization document that showcases each step a persona experiences with a product or service over a period of time. Personas are created with information gathered from user and stakeholder interviews. 
——————————————————————————————————————————
What journey maps include:	

	-Steps or activities a customer or user takes to accomplish a goal
	-Challenges they face in accomplishing their goal		
	-People they interact with in a single organization or in an ecosystem of organizations
	-Touchpoints and channels—like devices and apps—they encounter as they accomplish a goal
	-Feelings, thoughts, and reactions they have throughout their journey

As a result of these activities, you can identify the most important functionality an audience needs.

Business objectives for creating a journey map:

	-Create a differentiated customer experience
	-Acquire new customers	
	-Increase customers’ frequency of use of product or service
	-Integrate a new feature or service into your existing experience
	-Increase the efficiency or effectiveness of your product or service
	-Improve the completion rate of a specific task or goal
	-Improve service quality and reduce calls to support or service

 
Benefits:
	-Understanding customer pain points. Expose  places where the flow isn’t as smooth as it could be, and moments of dissatisfaction for your customers
	-Strategic thinking: Promote strategic conversations about where to invest your company’s resources and effort for the highest impact
	-A strong case for innovation: Expose the innovation work that needs to be done, and discover what matters most to customers

Scope:
When building a journey map, you want to make sure that its under the right scope, (ie: not too broad or too narrow). 

	If you build a journey map that’s too broad, your insights will be too general and hard to apply, and you can struggle to get the right performance data to track your success.

	If you build a map that’s too narrow, you’ll end up focusing exclusively on one element of the experience and miss the broader context, not to mention spending too much of your team’s time on a small piece of the picture.

We are currently using a free Lucidchart account to create some journey maps
There are other tools out there for journey maps but we're using Lucid chart for now
