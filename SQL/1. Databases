Databases
——————————————————————————————————————————
DB's are systems that allow users to store and organize data 
Useful when dealing with large amounts of data

DB's have/can 
	1. data integrity
	2. handle massive amounts of data
	3. quickly combine different datasets
	4. automate steps 
	5. can support data for websites and applications

There's no specific limit to how many tables / rows / attriibutes 
The only real boundary is how much space you have on your hard disk

SQL (structured query language) 
	- the programming language used to communicate with relational databases

postgreSQL / mySQL / SQL Server / Oracle / are different database engines 
some are free and opensource while others are not

Most SQL statements are universal and can be applied to all different db platforms but some statements are specific.
