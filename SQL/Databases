Databases

DB's are systems that allow users to store and organize data 
Useful when dealing with large amounts of data

DB's have/can 
	1. data integrity
	2. handle massive amounts of data
	3. quickly combine different datasets
	4. automate steps 
	5. can support data for websites and applications

SQL (structured query language) 
	- the programming language used to communicate with databases

Most SQL statements are universal and can be applied to all different db platforms but some statements are specific.

We will use PostgreSQL for our db and PgAdmin which is the GUI for PostgreSQL that makes things easier
