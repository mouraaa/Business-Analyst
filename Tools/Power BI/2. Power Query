Power Query:
——————————————————————————————————————————
Best Practices:

Defien clear file names and location for the files bc if you rename or move the files, it will be a headache to reconnect those sources again.

Once youre in the query editor:
	-update the file name
	-confirm that column headers have been promoted
	-ensure all the column data types are assigned correctly

Disable report fresh for files that wont be updates often

When working with large tables, only load the data you need
——————————————————————————————————————————
Things to Note:

Transform tab is for when you want to edit the current column
Add Column is when you want to add a new column

			distinct: total number of different values whether they appear once or multiple times (not count)
			unique: total number of values that appear exactly once 
			{1,1,2,3}
			3 distinct (1,2,3)
			2 unique (2,3)

	-you can hover over the quality box to see the number of records
