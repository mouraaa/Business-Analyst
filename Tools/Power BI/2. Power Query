Power Query:
——————————————————————————————————————————
Best Practices:

Defien clear file names and location for the files bc if you rename or move the files, it will be a headache to reconnect those sources again.

Once youre in the query editor:
	-update the file name
	-confirm that column headers have been promoted
	-ensure all the column data types are assigned correctly

Disable report fresh for files that wont be updates often

When working with large tables, only load the data you need
——————————————————————————————————————————
Things to Note:

Transform tab is for when you want to edit the current column
Add Column is when you want to add a new column

Data QA:
	-the process of clearing inconsistencies and other anomalies within data to improve the data quality
	-you should do this before you load your data into the front end
	-there are 3 data profile tools available in the "View" menu
	-note that the data profiling tools only analyze the first 1000 rows of the table
	-to update the column profiling, click on "column profiling based on first 1000 rows" on the very bottom

Column Quality:
	-shows the percentage of values within acolumn that are valid, contain errors or empty
	-you can hover over the quality box to see the number of records
	-you can click the option menu (eclipse) for more options

Column Distrbution:
	-provides a sample distribution od the data contained in a column
		ex: distinct vs unique
			distinct: total number of different values whether they appear once or multiple times (not count)
			unique: total number of values that appear exactly once 
			{1,1,2,3}
			3 distinct (1,2,3)
			2 unique (2,3)

	-you can hover over the quality box to see the number of records

Column Profile:
	-provides a holistic view of the data
	-count, error, empty, distinct vs unique, min & max, etc
	-you can hover over the quality box to see the number of records

Calculated Columns:
	-allows you to add new formula based columns to tables in a model
	-generates values for each row 
	-primarily used for filtering data in reports
	-understands row context (they can see the info contained within each row within which they calculate)
		ex: if statements from excel
			if(orderquantity > 1, "multiple order", "single order")
			the calculated column can see the orderquantity column and make decisions based on it

	-since it appends a new column, it increases file size

Only use calcualted columns when you want to create enw data and actually stamp static fixed data to each row in a table
Do not use calculated columns for aggregation. this is what measures are for.
use measures when aggregation is necessary or to use dyanmic values in a report/visual
