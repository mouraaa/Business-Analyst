Meetings:
——————————————————————————————————————————
As a business analyst you’re going to hold a lot of meetings, and people hate more meetings in their already busy schedules. Thankfully most people appreciate meetings that are productive. So your job is to make meetings as meaningful as possible.

Running a good meeting can make you look poised and professional, even if you don’t have the most experience in a given industry or domain.

Things to consider:

1. Provide an agenda before the meeting starts.
	-tells people what you hope to accomplish with their time
	-keeps the meeting on track (if it starts getting off track, you can return to the agenda as a way of bringing things to order)
	-gives everyone an opportunity to prepare questions and comments
	-if you need someone to contribute something specific, be sure to tell them personally so they can come prepared.

2. Put together a presentation for every meeting, no matter how small.
	-it makes you look prepared and in control
	-it gives your meeting structure, making it that much easier to follow your agenda
	-it acts as a signpost, so people know where you are in the meeting (even if they join late)
	-it can include information meant to provide context (ex: definitions) even if they’re not specifically addressed
	-it gives people something visual to focus on, which can help retain their attention

3. Use personas/stories as needed
	-stories create emotional connections and are memorable, which make the audience more engaged and less liekly to zone out.

4. Record your meetings
	-ask for permission first
	-dont need to worry about taking notes in the moment
	-recordings are better than notes/memory

5. Recap and RACI
	-near the end of the meeting, recap what was covered and summarize what was gained from everyone’s time together
	-identify who’s responsible for next steps
	-identify if anything from the agenda must be revisited in the next meeting

6. Send out meeting minutes
